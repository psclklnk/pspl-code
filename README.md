# A Probabilistic Interpretation of Self-Paced Learning with Applications to Reinforcement Learning

This repository simply contains the links to the individual repositories used for conducting experiment for the paper **A Probabilistic Interpretation of Self-Paced Learning with Applications to Reinforcement Learning** published in JMLR 2021.

The repositories are:
* [Episodic Experiments](https://github.com/psclklnk/self-paced-rl)
* [Step-Based Experiments](https://github.com/psclklnk/spdl)
 
Furthermore, the video contained in this repository visualizes the training progress of the "ball-in-a-cup" experiment as well as executions of the learned policy on the real system.
